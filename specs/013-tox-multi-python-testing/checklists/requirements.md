# Specification Quality Checklist: Verified Multi-Python-Version Local & CI Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- All items pass on first validation pass. Tool names mentioned in the user input (tox,
  setuptools, pytest, pyproject.toml) are grounding context for *why* this feature is needed,
  not requirements themselves — the spec.md requirements and success criteria are phrased in
  terms of outcomes (installs succeed, versions are verified, results are per-version visible)
  without mandating specific tools, deferring tool choice to `/speckit-plan`.
